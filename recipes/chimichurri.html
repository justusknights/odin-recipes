    <p>We've all been there; you've been invited to grill with some 
        friends but you don't want to shell out your hard-earned 
        cash on expensive steaks and you certainly don't want to be 
        the chump who brings unseasoned chicken... so what's the move???</p>
    <p>The answer is Chimichurri; it goes with anything grilled,
        from fish to bread, costs about $5 to make, and is sure to 
        impress anyone, both for its culinary prowess and the cultural
        clout you'll accumulate by bringing in such a staple of Southern 
        Cone cuisine.</p>
    <p>What's this operation gonna take?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A generous ammount of Olive Oil (single origin, extra virgin if possible)</li>
        <li>A little Red Wine Vinegar</li>
        <li>A bunch of Parsley (Italian or Curly will do)(by "a bunch" I mean 
            either a single unit sold in a bunch, or the figurative concept of 
            "a whole bunch of parsley" depending on how much you need to make 
            and how much you like parsley.</li>
        <li>2-5 cloves of Garlic </li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Crushed Red Pepper</li>
        <li>sage (optional)</li>
        <li>Thyme (optional)</li>
        <li>Red Bell Pepper (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Now for the fun part</h2>
    <p>Mince your parsley and garlic, the ratio should be determined 
        by how much you like either ingredient. You can do this in a 
        food processor or by hand. I personally prefer by hand because
        the texture is a bit more rough and traditional.</p>
    <p>With these two items minced, you'll toss them in a bowl or
        tupperware, flatten them across the bottom and cover them 
        with olive oil; please don't ask how much, just cover them. 
        You can't have too much olive oil.</p>
    <p>If you have elected to use the optional ingredients, good for you.
        You'll want to add those now. I recommend going light on the sage
        as it is rather bitter, and light on the Red Bell  Pepper as it 
        should not overpower the other flavors.</p>
    <p>With that complete, add your salt and pepper, and just a few
        splashes of red wine vinegar.</p>
    <p>Proceed to mix all ingredients together and give it a try.
        It will likely be rather sharp, feel free to add a pinch of
        sugar to fight this and adjust any other ingredients as needed.</p>
    <p>Let your lovely Chimi rest at room temperature for some time, ideallly
        overnight, but a few hours will do. This is what dulls that initial
        sharpness. The garlic needs time to absorb some of the vinegar and Oil
        to calm itself down.</p>
    <p>The last step of course is to show off this dish to your friends and 
        await the praise for such a unique offering. Do not under any 
        circumstances admit that you found this on the internet. 
        You of course need to imply that you got it from a friends grandmother 
        or aunt or some such vaguery to add a bit of story to the dish because, 
        let's face it, you brought a garnish to a cook-out...You're still a chump.

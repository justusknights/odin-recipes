    <p>You're probably not used to seeing Strogonoff as I'm going to present it here
        but trust me, you'll appreciate it. This is the traditional Brazilian approach
        to the dish, so it will be served over rice and made with cubed beef roast instead
        of ground beef. Let's get into.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Any cut of beef, cut into short strips or small cubes, about 1lb</li>
        <li>2 cups of sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 onion, minced</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 Tbspns olive oil</li>
        <li>3 small potatoes, cubed about the size of a fingernail</li>
        <li>1 quart of pure tomato sauce, no seasoning added</li>
        <li>heavy cream, to desired consistency/color</li>
        <li>3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>salt, pepper, and paprika to taste</li>
        <li>Worcestershire, a few dashes</li>
        <li>Potato straws/string potatoes as a garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Start by cooking your onion and garlic in olive oil on medium-high heat until the onion
        goes transparent. You'll then want to add your potatoes, beef, Worcestershire sauce, 
        bay leaves, some salt and pepper and paprika, though you'll likely be adding more of 
        those later. Let this cook on medium heat, stirring occasionally until the beef is cooked 
        through and softening and the potatoes are soft.
    </p>
    <p>At this point, you'll add your tomato sauce and mushrooms and let them cook all the way down
        on medium-low heat. You should end up with a reddish brown sauce that is relatively thick 
        and smells delicious. 
    </p>
    <p>You're nearly done! Taste this concoction, it should be salty, a bit sweet, but still sharper
        and more acidic than you'd want for a main course, which is perfect since the cream will dampen
        those factors considerably. Add any other seasoning at this point, you can add a bit of crushed
        red pepper for a kick, more paprika, or anything else you enjoy, but get all of that done now, 
        before adding the cream. 
    </p>
    <p>When you are happy with your base drop the heat to low and add the cream slowly. There is no "right" amount
        of cream, but there is definitely a wrong amount of cream. So go slow, you're looking for a pinkish brown, 
        slightly thick and creamy sauce. If you're paying attention, you'll know when you're there. Do not let the 
        sauce cook very long once the cream is added or the cream will begin to seperate; this does not harm the flavor, 
        but will make the dish look less appetizing.
    </p>
    <p>Once the cream is fully combined and the dish warm, serve over a bed of rice and top with potato straws.
        You now have made Brazilian Strogonoff. THe meat can be substituted for chicken or shrimp, and the mushrooms
        and potatoes are optional. Play around and see what you like best, but whatever the case, make sure you're 
        sharing with people that matter to you.
